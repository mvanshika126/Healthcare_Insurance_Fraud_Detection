I took a class in my graduate school,american Health Care system where in we were taught about the whole insurance system in the United Stated,having studying that in dept,promted me to carry out this project.

Healthcare_Insurance_Fraud_Detection using Binary Classification :Logistic regression

Health care fraud is a crime. It's committed when a dishonest provider or consumer intentionally submits, or causes someone else to submit, false or misleading information for use in determining the amount of health care benefits payable.

Some examples of provider health care fraud are:

billing for services not actually performed;
falsifying a patient's diagnosis to justify tests, surgeries or other procedures that aren't medically necessary;
misrepresenting procedures performed to obtain payment for non-covered services, such as cosmetic surgery;
upcoding – billing for a more costly service than the one actually performed;
unbundling – billing each stage of a procedure as if it were a separate procedure;
accepting kickbacks for patient referrals;
waiving patient co-pays or deductibles and over-billing the insurance carrier or benefit plan;
billing a patient more than the co-pay amount for services that were prepaid or paid in full by the benefit plan under the terms of a managed care contract.


Some examples of consumer health care fraud are:

filing claims for services or medications not received;
forging or altering bills or receipts;
using someone else's coverage or insurance card.

This project aims to create a logistic model,which can predict the health care insurance fraud.
